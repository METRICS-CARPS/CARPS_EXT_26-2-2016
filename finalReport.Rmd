This reproducibility report attempts to reproduce the target results of Pinsof & Haselton (2016), published in Psychological Science. The repository for this reproducibility project can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/mleake/CARPS_EXT_26-2-2016).

#### Methods summary: 

The authors designed a custom Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measure participants' implicit associations between homosexuality and sexual promiscuity. They randomly assigned participants to either the "gay men" or "lesbian" condition. There were four trials in the IAT. For two trials the words "gay" and "promiscuous" were presented on one side of the screen, and the words "straight" and "monogamous" were presented on the other side of the screen, and for the other two trials the words were placed on opposite sides. In each trial participants saw five words related to either promiscuity or monogamy and images of gay or lesbian couples. The authors compared the response times of associations between "gay" and "promiscuous" and "gay" and "monogamous" to measure particpants' mental associations between the terms "gay" and "promiscuous." The study was conducted on MTurk with a final sample size of 1085 participants.

------

#### Target outcomes: 
>The mean IAT score across both conditions was 0.59 (SD =
0.42), which indicates that participants' reaction times were,
on average, 0.59 standard deviations faster when "gay" and
"promiscuous" were paired than when "gay" and "monogamous"
were paired. Participants in the lesbians condition
showed slightly greater implicit associations between "gay"
and "promiscuous" (M = 0.62, SD = 0.42) than participants
in the gay-men condition did (M = 0.56, SD = 0.41),
t(1083) = 2.56, p < .05. Follow-up analyses revealed that
this effect was qualified by a significant interaction with
gender, F(1, 1081) = 7.42, p < .01. Among men, IAT scores
were significantly higher in the lesbians condition (M =
0.67, SD = 0.39) than in the gay-men condition (M = 0.53,
SD = 0.40), F(1, 1081) = 13.61, p < .001, whereas among
women, there was no significant difference in IAT scores
between the two conditions, F(1, 1081) = 0.01, p = .92. (from Pinsof & Haselton, 2016, p. 438)

# Step 1: Load packages and prepare report object

```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files
library(CARPSreports) # custom report functions
```

```{r}
# Prepare report object. This will be updated automatically by the reproCheck function each time values are compared
reportObject <- data.frame(dummyRow = TRUE, reportedValue = NA, obtainedValue = NA, valueType = NA, percentageError = NA, comparisonOutcome = NA, eyeballCheck = NA)
```

# Step 2: Load data

```{r}
data = read_sav("data/Same-Sex Marriage Dataset.sav")
colnames(data)[1] = "id" #change col name to avoid @# label
head(data)
```



# Step 3: Tidy data
```{r}
#subset the data to focus on the variables we care about
#note that each row becomes a particular individual's IAT score rather than each question 
#of the test (i.e., there's a 1-1 mapping for id to IAT score)
subset_data <- data %>%
  select(id, Condition, Gender, SexualOrientation, `Filter_$`, IATscore)

head(subset_data)
dim(subset_data)
```

# Step 4: Run analysis

## Pre-processing
```{r}
#use the provided filter column to filter data -- but also filter based on NA values
filtered_data <- subset_data %>% 
  filter(`Filter_$` == 1 & 
           !is.na(Condition) & 
           !is.na(IATscore) & 
           !is.na(Gender))
dim(filtered_data) #data should be 1085 x 6

# Step 5: Conclusion

This reproducibility check was mostly successful. We were able to replicate all of the implicit association findings except for one of the F-scores and its degrees of freedom, and one of the t-statistics. The cause of these discrepancies is unclear. It appears that the F-score reported in the paper for the comparison between the men gay and lesbian conditions is the sum of the F-scores for the Condition and Gender-Condition rows of the ANOVA result table. However, the F-score we compute is slightly higher (14.9 vs. 13.61). Also, we found a discrepancy between the t-statistic the authors reported and our value (t(1083) = 2.56 vs t(1081.6) = 2.47). In all cases though our p-values either matched or met the same criteria as the original.

The authors provided a list of exclusion criteria, but it appears they followed additional exclusion criteria they do not discuss in the paper. They excluded participants who did not list a gender on the survey. This additional exclusion criteria was needed to get the same participant count from the original paper.

# Assess the causal locus (discrete reproducibility issues) of any reproducibility errors. Note that there doesn't necessarily have to be a one-to-one correspondance between discrete reproducibility issues and reproducibility errors. For example, it could be that the original article neglects to mention that a Greenhouse-Geisser correct was applied to ANOVA outcomes. This might result in multiple reproducibility errors, but there is a single causal locus (discrete reproducibility issue).

This is a subjective judgement, but you should taking into account multiple factors, such as the presence/absence of decision errors, the number of target outcomes that could not be reproduced, the type of outcomes that could or could not be reproduced, the difference in magnitude of effect sizes, and the predictions of the specific hypothesis under scrutiny.
