For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Implicit associationsThe mean IAT score across both conditions was 0.59 (SD =0.42), which indicates that participants’ reaction times were,on average, 0.59 standard deviations faster when “gay” and“promiscuous” were paired than when “gay” and “monogamous”were paired. Participants in the lesbians conditionshowed slightly greater implicit associations between “gay”and “promiscuous” (M = 0.62, SD = 0.42) than participantsin the gay-men condition did (M = 0.56, SD = 0.41),t(1083) = 2.56, p < .05. Follow-up analyses revealed thatthis effect was qualified by a significant interaction withgender, F(1, 1081) = 7.42, p < .01. Among men, IAT scoreswere significantly higher in the lesbians condition (M =0.67, SD = 0.39) than in the gay-men condition (M = 0.53,SD = 0.40), F(1, 1081) = 13.61, p < .001, whereas amongwomen, there was no significant difference in IAT scoresbetween the two conditions, F(1, 1081) = 0.01, p = .92.
