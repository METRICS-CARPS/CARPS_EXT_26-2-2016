#### Methods summary: 

[PILOT/COPILOT write a brief summary of the methods underlying the target outcomes written in your own words]

The authors designed a custom Implicit Association Test (IAT) 
to measure participants' implicit associations between homosexuality 
and sexual promiscuity. They randomly assigned participants to either 
the "gay men" or "lesbian" condition. There were four trials in the IAT. 
For two trials the words "gay" and "promiscuous" were presented on one 
side of the screen, and the words "straight" and "monogamous" were 
presented on the other side of the screen, and for the other two trials 
the words were placed on opposite sides. In each trial participants saw 
five words related to either promiscuity or monogamy and images of gay 
or lesbian couples. The authors compared the response times of 
associations between "gay" and "promiscuous" and "gay" and "monogamous" 
to measure particpants' mental associations between the terms "gay" and 
"promiscuous." The study was conducted on MTurk with a final sample size of
1085 participants.

#### Target outcomes: 

[PILOT copy and paste the target outcomes identified in targetOutcomes.md]  

The mean IAT score across both conditions was 0.59 (SD =
0.42), which indicates that participants’ reaction times were,
on average, 0.59 standard deviations faster when “gay” and
“promiscuous” were paired than when “gay” and “monogamous”
were paired. Participants in the lesbians condition
showed slightly greater implicit associations between “gay”
and “promiscuous” (M = 0.62, SD = 0.42) than participants
in the gay-men condition did (M = 0.56, SD = 0.41),
t(1083) = 2.56, p < .05. Follow-up analyses revealed that
this effect was qualified by a significant interaction with
gender, F(1, 1081) = 7.42, p < .01. Among men, IAT scores
were significantly higher in the lesbians condition (M =
0.67, SD = 0.39) than in the gay-men condition (M = 0.53,
SD = 0.40), F(1, 1081) = 13.61, p < .001, whereas among
women, there was no significant difference in IAT scores
between the two conditions, F(1, 1081) = 0.01, p = .92.

# Step 1: Load packages and prepare report object

[PILOT/COPILOT Some useful packages are being loaded below. You can add any additional ones you might need too.]

```{r}
# load packages
library(tidyverse) # for data munging
library(knitr) # for kable table formating
library(haven) # import and export 'SPSS', 'Stata' and 'SAS' Files
library(readxl) # import excel files

```{r}
# Prepare report object. This will be updated automatically by the reproCheck function each time values are compared

# Step 2: Load data

```{r}

# Step 3: Tidy data
```{r}
#subset the data to focus on the variables we care about
#note that each row becomes a particular individual's IAT score rather than each question 
#of the test (i.e., there's a 1-1 mapping for id to IAT score)

# Step 4: Run analysis

## Pre-processing
```{r}
#use the provided filter column to filter data -- but also filter based on NA values
filtered_data <- filter(subset_data, `Filter_$` == 1 & !is.na(Condition) & !is.na(IATscore) & !is.na(Gender))

# Step 5: Conclusion

[Please include a text summary describing your findings. If this reproducibility check was a failure, you should note any suggestions as to what you think the likely cause(s) might be.]

This reproducibility check was mostly successful. We were able to replicate all of the implicit association findings except for one of the F-scores and one of the t-statistics. The cause of these discrepancies is unclear. It appears that the F-score reported in the paper for the comparison between the men gay and lesbian conditions is the sum of the F-scores for the Condition and Gender-Condition rows of the ANOVA result table. However, the F-score we compute is slightly higher (14.9 vs. 13.61). The p-value reported (p < .001) is consistent with what we found. Also, we found a discrepancy between the t-statistic the authors reported and our value (t(1083) = 2.56 vs t(1081.6) = 2.47). Again, the p-value remains below 0.05, as the authors reported.

The authors provided a list of exclusion criteria, but it appears they followed additional exclusion criteria they do not discuss in the paper. They excluded participants who did not list a gender on the survey. This additional exclusion criteria was needed to get the same participant count from the original paper.
